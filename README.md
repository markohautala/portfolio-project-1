# Interior Design Art
Welcome to Interior Design Art - ID Art.

This website is intended to showcase a interior stylists brand, gallery (references) and the contact section reach the stylists.
The website contains of three html-pages - homepage, contact-page and a gallery-page.




### Problems that i have encountered along the way
- The images would not show up altough I did write the css rule correctly - what I did notice was that the images folder was not inside of the assets folder. This was easily fixed.
- The iframe is stuck under the footer - they should both be fully visible and be aligned next to each other. This was solved by removing the property of height: 100vh; in the main-section.
- The h1 heading moved itself when i added divs into index.html, and this was fixed by making it have the value of relative instead of absolute to the position-property.

### What tools i have used
- Font awesome for the icons
- TinyPNG to make all the imagefiles smaller
- All the images in the website are copyright-free from [this link] (<https://unsplash.com/s/photos/interior>)

to-do-list:

-add meta tags and favicon
-font family fallbacks
-description and keywords in meta for SEO purpose
