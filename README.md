Welcome to Interior Design Art - ID Art.

This website is intended to showcase a interior stylists brand, gallery (references) and the contact section reach the stylists.
The website contains of three html-pages - homepage, contact-page and a gallery-page.




Problems that i have encountered along the way:
- the images would not show up and I did write the css rule correctly - what I did notice was that the images folder was not inside of the assets folder. This was easily fixed.
- the iframe is stuck under the footer - they should both be fully visible and be aligned next to each other. This was solved by not having the property of height: 100vh; in the main-section.
